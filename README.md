Hi there, I am Vincenzo. Having a business consulting background in the tech industry with heavy product management influences and customer focus, I was always drawn to data driven decisions and creative problem solving. It came very natural to start coding and I immediately got interested in the logic behind web applications and data flows.

I am a big fan of JavaScript, Google Apps Script, SQL, Excel and Google Spreadsheets. Currently learning Python.
