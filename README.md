### Hi there, I'm Vincenzo 👋

I am a former Strategy Consultant turned **Senior Analytics Engineer** with expertise across the entire data value chain and deep experience in tech product development and operations.

Currently, my team and I architect the data landscape for **Zalando's** merchant platform using the modern data stack: **Databricks and PySpark**. I focus on building scalable solutions for both internal decision-makers and external customers, constantly exploring new patterns in data engineering to improve our work.

From founding an international fashion company and consulting haute couture brands in Paris to leading strategic initiatives for Europe's largest e-commerce platforms, I've developed a cross-industry approach to complex problem-solving.
